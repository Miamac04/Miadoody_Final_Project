    <p>
      I’m a third-year college student at San Francisco State University, and I’m going into my final year as a Visual Communication Design major. I’m also a first generation college student, which means I’m the first in my family to go to college. I’ve learned a lot along the way and grown more confident in myself.

I chose design because I love being creative and expressing myself through art. I enjoy making things that look good and also share a message. Whether I’m working on a school project or just designing for fun, I like how design gives me a chance to use my imagination. Playing around with color, shapes, and fonts lets me turn ideas into something real that people can see and connect with.

As I finish up college, I’m really excited about what’s next. My main goal is to become a logo designer. I want to help businesses and brands stand out by creating logos that are simple, creative, and easy to remember. I’ve always liked the idea of helping others bring their vision to life through design.

I also hope to start my own small business someday. Maybe I’ll open a shop on Etsy or a similar website where I can sell my artwork, stickers, or other fun designs. I think it would be great to have my own space to share the things I create and run something that’s completely my own.
